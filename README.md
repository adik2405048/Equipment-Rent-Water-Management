# Equipment-Rent-Water-Management
Irrigation Planning & Farm Equipment Rental System
As a **BSc Agricultural Engineering student at Bangladesh Agricultural University**, I’m passionate about using technology to solve real challenges farmers face. That’s why I built this project combining two crucial needs:
• Smart Irrigation Planning
• Easy Farm Equipment Rental

Key Features:- 
Equipment Catalog & Booking
• Browse tractors, power tillers, drones, pumps, and sprayers.
• Check rental rates (hourly/daily/seasonal).
• Real-time availability with booking confirmation.
Pricing & Packages
• Discounts for long-term rentals.
• Shared rental option for smallholder farmers.
Location-Based Matching
• Farmers can filter equipment by district/upazila.
• Localized results for easier access.
Irrigation Water Planner
• Farmers input crop + land area → system calculates water requirement.
• Provides **Bangla-language water-saving tips** to promote sustainability.

This project aims to help farmers in Bangladesh:
Save costs by accessing equipment without owning them.
Reduce groundwater misuse through smart irrigation planning.
Empower small farmers by enabling shared rentals and transparent pricing.
